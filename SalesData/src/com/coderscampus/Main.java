//        In this assignment you will be analyzing sales data for the sales of Tesla vehicles between 2016 and 2019.
//
//        Your job will be to read the data from 3 different CSV files and store that information for analysis and reporting.
//
//                You will need to use Java Streams to go through this data and output the following information onto the console:
//
//        Note: anywhere you see #### or yyyy-MM, you'll need to output actual numbers / dates based on your analysis.


        // Model 3 Yearly Sales Report
//        2017 -> 1,770
//        2018 -> 139,782
//        2019 -> 158,925
//
//        The best month for Model 3 was: 2019-12
//        The worst month for Model 3 was: 2017-07

//        The worst month for Model X was: 2016-01 and 2016-02


//        Hints
//
//        You don't need to output this entire report in a single stream.
//
//        You'll want to read the data into three separate Lists.
//
//        You will likely need to stream through each of the Lists a few times to be able to output all the necessary data in the report.
//
//        Remember that grouping data is an important thing to do.
